# 🚀 **TSP Solver: CPU vs GPU Performance Comparison**

This project contains two Python programs to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and compare the performance between **CPU and GPU (CUDA via CuPy)** implementations.

## ✨ **Features**

### 📌 `graph.py`

* 🔹 Generates a complete graph with **N=10 vertices** (configurable).
* 🔹 Computes **Euclidean distances** with ±20% random variation.
* 🔹 Plots the graph using **NetworkX** and **Matplotlib**.
* 🔹 Finds the **optimal TSP path using brute force**.
* 🔹 Saves the graph data to `tsp_dados.json` and `tsp_dados.pkl`.

📸 *Suggestion: Add a figure of the generated graph and optimal path here.*

---

### 📌 `tsp.py`

* 🔹 Loads data generated by `graph.py`.
* 🔹 Solves TSP using brute force:

  * ✅ **CPU**: Sequential with `itertools.permutations`
  * ⚡ **GPU**: Parallel with **CuPy**, in batches
* 🔹 Measures execution time and calculates **speedup**.
* 🔹 Plots results and saves them to `resultados_cpu_gpu.json`.

📸 *Suggestion: Add a bar chart comparing CPU and GPU times here.*

---

## ⚙️ **Requirements**

* ✅ Python 3.6 or higher
* 📦 Required libraries:

  * `numpy`
  * `matplotlib`
  * `networkx`
  * `cupy` (optional, for GPU)

### 💻 GPU Requirements (Optional)

* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
* CUDA Toolkit and drivers installed

---

## 🧪 **Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tsp-solver.git
cd tsp-solver

# Install required Python packages
pip install numpy matplotlib networkx

# (Optional) For GPU support:
pip install cupy
```

## ▶️ **How to Use**

### 1. 🧱 **Generate the Graph**

```bash
python graph.py
```

Outputs:

* Complete graph plot
* Optimal path plot
* Files: `tsp_dados.json` and `tsp_dados.pkl`

---

### 2. ⚖️ **Compare CPU vs GPU**

```bash
python tsp.py
```

Outputs:

* Execution times for both CPU and GPU
* GPU speedup
* Visual charts
* File: `resultados_cpu_gpu.json`

---

## 💡 **Example Output**

### From `graph.py`:

```
=== TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM GRAPH GENERATOR ===
Generating graph with N=10 vertices...
Graph generated successfully!
Optimal path found: [0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 1, 4, 8, 3, 6, 0]
Total distance: 123.45
Data saved to 'tsp_dados.json' and 'tsp_dados.pkl'
```

### From `tsp.py`:

```
=== TSP SOLVER: CPU vs GPU ===
Data loaded: 10 vertices
Known optimal solution: 123.45
CPU - Brute force completed in 0.1234 seconds
GPU - Brute force completed in 0.0987 seconds
Speedup: 1.25x
Results saved to 'resultados_cpu_gpu.json'
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

* 🚨 For $N > 10$, execution time increases drastically due to factorial growth $(N-1)!$
* ⚡ GPU acceleration requires **CuPy** and a compatible NVIDIA GPU
* 🔧 To change the number of vertices, edit the `N` variable in `graph.py`
* 🔁 The use of `np.random.seed(42)` ensures **reproducibility**

---

## 📊 **Limitations**

* The permutation generation still occurs on the **CPU**, which may become a bottleneck for large $N$
* The solver only supports **symmetric** TSP instances without constraints
